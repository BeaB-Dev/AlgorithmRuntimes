# Algorithm Runtimes

A simple web application for comparing the runtimes of common programming algorithms.

### About

This app displays information on common programming algorithms, including pseudocode and use cases. It's written in Vue 3 and uses Bulma to simplify styling.
**Note:** Currently, when the browser reloads on the /algorithms page the full (currently short) list of algorithms will load.

### Usage

1. From the home page, search for an algorithm via the search bar or click on Searching Algorithms or Sorting Algorithms to select multiple. The Algorithms page will load and display the selected choices.

2. On the Algorithms page, select a tile and click the through the carousel. The following information is available:
    - Description
    - Time Complexity
    - Use Cases
    - Pseudocode
